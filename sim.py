# Add a MOF into the simulation through reading the .cif file

# Code to find the center of the MOF's pores in order to add the TFSi anion

# Place Li cations near the Mg sites in the MOF

# Sourround the MOF with  solvent (CH3OCH3)

# Perform an energy minimization to relax the solution
# Output the relaxed system to an xyz file
